This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating a common error: dereferencing an undefined variable. The script `bug.pl` shows the problematic code, which leads to a runtime error.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.pl`, shows how to correctly handle undefined variables using the `defined` function to avoid the error. This example highlights the importance of defensive programming in Perl to prevent unexpected crashes and enhance code robustness.
